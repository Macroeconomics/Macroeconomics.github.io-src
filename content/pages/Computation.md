We will be using (I)Python as our programming language. In order to use some of the material available on this website and to share your material with others you should create a [<i class="fa fa-github fa-1x"></i>GitHub](http://github.com/) account for yourself. This will be useful to you in the future to keep track of changes when you are writing papers. I also recommend creating a [<i class="fa fa-bitbucket fa-1x"></i>Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) account, which has similar functionality, but allows you to have unlimited private repositories for personal use. Additionally, I suggest you read [Gentzkow & Shapiro's *Code and Data for the Social Sciences: A Practitioner’s Guide*](https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/CodeAndData.pdf) to familiarize yourself with good practices in coding and statistical analysis. We will cover additional topics in class.
