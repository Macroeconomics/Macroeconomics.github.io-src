## Access to our Deepnote project

To view and execute our code you can access our [Deepnote project](https://deepnote.com/join-team?token=1caea1e0f7cc466) or its notebooks directly:

- [Report Tables and Figures](https://deepnote.com/workspace/replication-dickens-2022-ff5e06ca-d8fd-4344-b73c-7d07c01f9c63/project/1-Report-Tables-and-Figures-2158a300-6955-4725-92f2-79476c32a378) 
    - This notebook produces all the figures and tables found in the report.

- [Construction of the Alternative Data](https://deepnote.com/workspace/replication-dickens-2022-ff5e06ca-d8fd-4344-b73c-7d07c01f9c63/project/2-Construction-of-the-Alternative-Data-4a945f27-2c4c-4244-8f3b-ab6dff812a2f)
    - This project uses the Ethnologe v16 and v17 to reconstruct buffer zones used in the replication report. Due to Ethnologue's copyright, you will not be able to execute most of the notebooks as the underlying data is not available (if you have an Ethnologue license you should be able to run after changing the path to the location of Ethnologue). However, you can view how we constructed the data and each cell output. This should allow you to use similar tools and approaches for your own work.

## Upgrade to Education Plan      
    
If you created your account with a .EDU email you can access the educational benefits.

FYI, you can use your GMAIL account if you prefer in step 2 in the *Step-by-step guide* section. Then use your institutional email account to verify your educational status and still get the free tools and account upgrades. The only difference (as far as I can tell) is how you log in.

1.  Click on **Billing & usage**.  

    ![Click billing & usage](../images/pics/canvas_uploaded_img/12-Deepnote-click-billing-and-usage.png)  
      
    
2.  Click on **Change plan**.  

    ![Change plan](../images/pics/canvas_uploaded_img/12-Deepnote-billing-and-usage.png)  
      
    
3.  Now, you should be on the **Upgrade** page. Click on **Upgrade to Education**.  

    ![Upgrade to education](../images/pics/canvas_uploaded_img/13-Deepnote-upgrade-education.png)  
      
    
4.  Use your YOUREMAIL@SMU.EDU to fill out the required information.  

    ![Add you education email account](../images/pics/canvas_uploaded_img/14-Deepnote-education-plan-email.png)  
      
    
5.  The system will send you another verification email. Click on **Verify my email**.  

    ![Verification email](../images/pics/canvas_uploaded_img/15-Deepnote-verification-email.png)
