Don't you sometimes wish you had a time machine? Well, now you can! At least for your documents, scripts, etc. using [Github](https://github.com/). Since we will be coding and writing to perform analyses, it is useful to be able to keep histories of our files so we can recover material we may have changed or discarded in the past. With [Github](https://github.com/), you can also copy (fork) other people's projects and give them feedback, suggest improvements, or correct their errors. It is a powerful tool for collaboration.

Sign-up for GitHub Account
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In a web browser open [GitHub's webpage](https://github.com/) and select the `Signup for GitHub` option and follow the steps to create your account. You can use your personal or institutional `edu` email (or both). I suggest using your  `XXX@YYY.edu` email to ensure you get all the educational benefits. **Note**: You can create the account with your personal email and request educational benefits afterwards also (a bit more involved, but you will not have to change email accounts if you change/leave institutions).

Download GitHub Utilities
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Head over to [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and download their utilities for your operating system (OS). The [GitHub Desktop App](https://desktop.github.com/) makes interacting with `git` and `GitHub` a breeze.
